Vimium - The Hacker's Browser
=============================

Vimium is a Chrome extension that provides keyboard based navigation and control in the spirit of the Vim
editor.

__Installation instructions:__

You can install the stable version of Vimium from the
[Chrome Extensions Gallery](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb).

Alternatively, you can install it from source:

1. Navigate to chrome://extensions
2. Click on "Load Extension..."
3. Select the vimium directory.

The Settings page can be found by clicking the Options button next to Vimium on chrome://extensions.

Keyboard Bindings
-----------------

<c-x> is to be interpreted as ctrl + x together.

Navigating the current page:
    h       scroll left
    j       scroll down
    k       scroll up
    l       scroll right
    gg      scroll to top of the page
    G       scroll to bottom of the page
    <c-e>   scroll down a page
    <c-y>   scroll up a page
    f       activate link hints mode to open in current page
    F       activate link hints mode to open in new tab
    r       reload
    gf      view source
    zi      zoom in
    zo      zoom out
    /       enter find mode -- type your search query and hit enter to search or esc to cancel
    n       cycle forward to the next find match
    N       cycle backward to the previous find match
    i       enter insert mode -- all commands will be ignored until you hit esc to exit
    y       copy the current url to the clipboard

Navigating your history:
    ba, H         go back in history
    fw, fo, L     go forward in history

Manipulating tabs:
    J, gT      go one tab left
    K, gt      go one tab right
    t          create tab
    d          close current tab
    u          restore closed tab (i.e. unwind the 'd' command)

Vimium supports command repetition so, for example, hitting '5t' will open 5 tabs in rapid succession. ESC (or
<c-[>) will clear any partial commands in the queue.

Release Notes
-------------

1.15 (unreleased)

-  Make the CSS used by the link hints configurable. It's under Advanced Options.

1.14 (01/21/2010)

-  Fixed a bug introduced in 1.13 that prevented excluded URLs from being saved.

1.13 (01/21/2010)

-  <c-f> and <c-b> are now mapped to scroll a full page up or down respectively.
-  Bugfixes related to entering insert mode when the page first loads, and when focusing Flash embeds.
-  Added command listing to the Options page for easy reference.
-  J & K have reversed for tab switching: J goes left and K goes right.
-  <c-[> is now equivalent to ESC, to match the behavior of VIM.
-  <c-e> & <c-y> are now mapped to scroll down and up respectively.
-  The characters used for link hints are now configurable under Advanced Options.

1.11, 1.12 (01/08/2010)
